[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/react-eclipsefdn-members.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/react-eclipsefdn-members) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b0087dce-17ae-46f6-bbea-b3813d35be3f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eclipsefdn-react-members/deploys)

Supported by our member organizations, the Eclipse Foundation provides our community with Intellectual Property, Mentorship, Marketing, Event and IT Services.

## Getting Started

Before you start, please make sure you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) installed.

Once that's done, you can install dependencies, build assets and start a dev server:

```bash
yarn --cwd src/main/www
yarn --cwd src/main/www build
yarn --cwd src/main/www start
yarn --cwd src/main/www start-spec
```

The web app will run in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Running the project in included web server

### Dependencies to run  

- Docker-compose
- Maven
- Java version 11

### Setup

As part of the set up, you will need to create a `secret.properties` file within the `./config` folder and set up the secrets that are required to run the application. If named `secret.properties`, the file should be ignored by Github automatically, making it less risky that credentials are accidentally uploaded to a branch.  

The fields required to run are the datasource and OIDC properties. The datasource properties should be a set of user credentials that can write to a local mariadb instance. Within that mariadb instance, a database should be created to contain the data used in development. Once created, a JDBC URL can now be formed for the new database. This URL should follow the pattern below, with port not always required (depending on your local setup and proxy settings).  This will be set in the `secret.properties` file. 

```  
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:mariadb://<host><:port?>/<databaseName>
```  

Once this is set, set the `quarkus.datasource.username` and `quarkus.datasource.password` fields to the user with access to the given database in the `secret.properties` file. 

The other half of secret configuration is setting up the OIDC credentials for connecting to a keycloak server. This server will require a realm to be set up for access. Using the name `rem_realm` is easiest as it requires no changes to the configuration to work.  

The `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` property in the `secret.properties` file will need to be updated. The value set should be the public realm address for your server and realm. The rest of the endpoints will be taken care of by the wellknown endpoint available in Keycloak, and don't need to be configured. For the dockerized service, this should be set to your local IP address (note, not your public address). This can be retrieved from your IP configuration application and added in the format displayed in the `sample.secret.properties` file.

Inside that realm, create a client and update the `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property within the `secret.properties` file. Inside that client, open the settings and go to the credentials tab. The secret will need to be copied and set into the `secret.properties` file in the `quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.value` property. For proper reading and usage of development data, 3 users should be created and added to the realm with the usernames `user1`, `user2`, and `user3`.  

With these properties updated, the server should be able to start and authenticate properly. If the 3 users mentioned within the OIDC configuration section were added, the data should be accessible in a way that is comparable to how it would be in production.

As a side note, regeneration of the database on start along with the insertion of data into the database can be disabled for development environments by setting the following fields within `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

1. Setting `%dev.eclipse.dataloader.enabled` to false. This property is what enables the Data bootstrap to load in mock data.  
2. Removing the `%dev.quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation` property or commenting it out. This is what resets the database to empty on start.

### Running

To run the server as a local instance as a stack, you will need to compile the application first, which can be done through `make compile`. This takes care of all of the steps needed to cleanly build and rebuild the application from scratch. To run the stack with the packaged application, use `docker-compose up -d`.

### Docker

We include a `docker-compose.yml` file with this project to help you get started. This includes:

* [mariadb:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)
* [postgres:12.4](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
* [jboss/keycloak:11.0.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/)
* [osixia/openldap](https://hub.docker.com/r/osixia/openldap)*
* [osixia/phpldapadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/osixia/phpldapadmin)*

*OpenLDAP is not required for the moment but we are including for testing purposes with Keycloak.

#### Generate Certs for HTTPS

, You will need to create a certificate in order to serve the Application on https. Make sure that the Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) is set to `www.rem.docker`.

```sh
make generate-cert
```

#### Update your Host file

We use [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy) as automated Nginx reverse proxy for our docker containers. So instead of having to lookup the port of a new service, you can simply remember it's internal dev hostname.

Different operating system, different file paths!

Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
Linux / MacOS: /etc/hosts

```
# rem services

127.0.0.1 keycloak
127.0.0.1 api.rem.docker
127.0.0.1 www.rem.docker
127.0.0.1 ldap-admin.rem.docker
```

#### Environment Variables

To use our `docker-compose.yml` file, create a `.env` file in the root of this project and insert your key/value pairs in the following format of KEY=VALUE. You must make sure to update the value of each variable:

```sh
REM_KEYCLOAK_USER=user_sample
REM_KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=password_sample
REM_LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password_sample
REM_MYSQL_PASSWORD=password_sample
REM_POSTGRES_DB=keycloak_sample
REM_POSTGRES_USER=keycloak_sample
REM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password_sample
```

Once this initial setup is done, you can start these services with this command:

```sh
make compile-start
```

### KeyCloak Setup

#### Create a realm

Realm is a concept in Keycloak that refers to an object managing a set of users along with their credentials, roles and groups. To create a `realm`, visit [Keycloak Admin Console](http://localhost:8080/auth/admin), mouse hover where it says `master` and click on `Add Realm`, set the name to `rem_realm` and click `create`.

#### Create a user

To create a `user`, visit [Keycloak Admin Console](http://localhost:8080/auth/admin) and click on `Users` in the left menu. Then press the `Add User` button and fill up the form with information about the user you wish to create.

To login as the user, you will need to set an initial password. To set a password, click on `Credentials`,  then set a password via the `Set Password` form. You will need to enter it twice to confirm it. You will probably want to disable `Temporary` password by clicking on the `ON` button to turn that feature off.

#### Client Configuration

Clients tab allows you to manage list of allowed applications.

To create a client, click on `Clients` in the left menu. You can set the client_id to `rem_app` and the `Root URL` to `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure that the `Client Protocol` is set to `openid-connect`  and the `Access Type` is set to `confidential`.
