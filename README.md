# react-eclipsefdn-members

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/react-eclipsefdn-members.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/react-eclipsefdn-members)

Supported by our member organizations, the Eclipse Foundation provides our community with Intellectual Property, Mentorship, Marketing, Event and IT Services.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Running the project in included web server

A prerequisite to running the Java web server locally is installing the external Jar dependencies for the Eclipse Foundation Java SDK. This provides bundling of common Quarkus functionality and models used in creating APIs. Eventually this will be available in a public repository, but for now it is only available in packaged jars. The jars can be installed using the below maven commands in the project root directory: 

```  
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$(pwd)/lib/eclipsefdn-java-sdk-core-0.1-BETA.jar \
-DgroupId=org.eclipsefoundation \
-DartifactId=eclipsefdn-java-sdk-core \
-Dversion=0.1-BETA \
-Dpackaging=jar

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$(pwd)/lib/eclipsefdn-java-sdk-persistence-deployment-0.1-BETA.jar \
-DgroupId=org.eclipsefoundation \
-DartifactId=eclipsefdn-java-sdk-persistence-deployment \
-Dversion=0.1-BETA \
-Dpackaging=jar

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$(pwd)/lib/eclipsefdn-java-sdk-persistence-0.1-BETA.jar \
-DgroupId=org.eclipsefoundation \
-DartifactId=eclipsefdn-java-sdk-persistence \
-Dversion=0.1-BETA \
-Dpackaging=jar
```
